I had trouble using chess.js in an Angular project. I kept getting Webpack errors. Perhaps I was doing something wrong. Anyway, I ended up converting the chess.js file to a chess.ts Typescript file. I thought I'd try and make an npm package out of it and add some tests. This is very much work in progress.
